    "Spark SQL is a Spark module for structured data processing. Unlike the\n",
    "basic Spark RDD API, the interfaces provided by Spark SQL provide Spark\n",
    "with more information about the structure of both the data and the\n",
    "computation being performed. Internally, Spark SQL uses this extra\n",
    "information to perform extra optimizations. There are several ways to\n",
    "interact with Spark SQL including SQL and the Dataset API. When\n",
    "computing a result, the same execution engine is used, independent of\n",
    "which API/language you are using to express the computation. This\n",
    "unification means that developers can easily switch back and forth\n",
    "between different APIs based on which provides the most natural way to\n",
    "express a given transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the examples on this page use sample data included in the Spark\n",
    "distribution and can be run in the `spark-shell`, `pyspark` shell, or\n",
    "`sparkR` shell.\n",

    "Python does not have the support for the Dataset API. But due to\n",
    "Python’s dynamic nature, many of the benefits of the Dataset API are\n",
    "already available (i.e. you can access the field of a row by name\n",
    "naturally `row.columnName`). The case for R is similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "A DataFrame is a *Dataset* organized into named columns. It is\n",
    "conceptually equivalent to a table in a relational database or a data\n",
    "frame in R/Python, but with richer optimizations under the hood.\n",
    "DataFrames can be constructed from a wide array of\n",
    "[sources](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources.html)\n",
    "such as: structured data files, tables in Hive, external databases, or\n",
