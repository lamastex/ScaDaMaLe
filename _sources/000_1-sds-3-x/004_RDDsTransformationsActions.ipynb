    "\n",
    "-   Resilient distributed datasets (RDDs) are the primary abstraction in\n",
    "    Spark.\n",
    "-   RDDs are immutable once created:\n",
    "    -   can transform it.\n",
    "    -   can perform actions on it.\n",
    "    -   but cannot change an RDD once you construct it.\n",
    "-   Spark tracks each RDD's lineage information or recipe to enable its\n",
    "    efficient recomputation if a machine fails.\n",
    "-   RDDs enable operations on collections of elements in parallel.\n",
    "-   We can construct RDDs by:\n",
    "    -   parallelizing Scala collections such as lists or arrays\n",
    "    -   by transforming an existing RDD,\n",
    "    -   from files in distributed file systems such as (HDFS, S3, etc.).\n",
    "-   We can specify the number of partitions for an RDD\n",
    "-   The more partitions in an RDD, the more opportunities for\n",
    "    parallelism\n",
    "-   There are **two types of operations** you can perform on an RDD:\n",
    "    -   **transformations** (are lazily evaluated)\n",
    "        -   map\n",
    "        -   flatMap\n",

    "-   Spark transformations enable us to create new RDDs from an existing\n",
    "    RDD.\n",
    "-   RDD transformations are lazy evaluations (results are not computed\n",
    "    right away)\n",
    "-   Spark remembers the set of transformations that are applied to a\n",
    "    base data set (this is the lineage graph of RDD)\n",
    "-   The allows Spark to automatically recover RDDs from failures and\n",
    "    slow workers.\n",
    "-   The lineage graph is a recipe for creating a result and it can be\n",
    "    optimized before execution.\n",
