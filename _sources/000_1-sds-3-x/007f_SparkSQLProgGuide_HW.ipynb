    "Spark SQL can also act as a distributed query engine using its JDBC/ODBC\n",
    "or command-line interface. In this mode, end-users or applications can\n",
    "interact with Spark SQL directly to run SQL queries, without the need to\n",
    "write any code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the Thrift JDBC/ODBC server\n",
    "-----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The Thrift JDBC/ODBC server implemented here corresponds to the\n",
    "[`HiveServer2`](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Setting+Up+HiveServer2)\n",
    "in Hive 1.2.1 You can test the JDBC server with the beeline script that\n",
    "comes with either Spark or Hive 1.2.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start the JDBC/ODBC server, run the following in the Spark directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ./sbin/start-thriftserver.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "This script accepts all `bin/spark-submit` command line options, plus a\n",
    "`--hiveconf` option to specify Hive properties. You may run\n",
    "`./sbin/start-thriftserver.sh --help` for a complete list of all\n",
    "available options. By default, the server listens on localhost:10000.\n",
    "You may override this behaviour via either environment variables, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    export HIVE_SERVER2_THRIFT_PORT=<listening-port>\n",
    "    export HIVE_SERVER2_THRIFT_BIND_HOST=<listening-host>\n",
    "    ./sbin/start-thriftserver.sh \\\n",
    "      --master <master-uri> \\\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "\n",
    "or system properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ./sbin/start-thriftserver.sh \\\n",
    "      --hiveconf hive.server2.thrift.port=<listening-port> \\\n",
    "      --hiveconf hive.server2.thrift.bind.host=<listening-host> \\\n",
    "      --master <master-uri>\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can use beeline to test the Thrift JDBC/ODBC server:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ./bin/beeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Connect to the JDBC/ODBC server in beeline with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    beeline> !connect jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000\n",
    "\n",
    "Beeline will ask you for a username and password. In non-secure mode,\n",
    "simply enter the username on your machine and a blank password. For\n",
    "secure mode, please follow the instructions given in the [beeline\n",
    "documentation](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients).\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration of Hive is done by placing your `hive-site.xml`,\n",
    "`core-site.xml` and `hdfs-site.xml` files in `conf/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also use the beeline script that comes with Hive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thrift JDBC server also supports sending thrift RPC messages over HTTP\n",
    "transport. Use the following setting to enable HTTP mode as system\n",
    "property or in `hive-site.xml` file in `conf/`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    hive.server2.transport.mode - Set this to value: http\n",
    "    hive.server2.thrift.http.port - HTTP port number fo listen on; default is 10001\n",
    "    hive.server2.http.endpoint - HTTP endpoint; default is cliservice\n",
    "\n",
    "To test, use beeline to connect to the JDBC/ODBC server in http mode\n",
    "with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    beeline> !connect jdbc:hive2://<host>:<port>/<database>?hive.server2.transport.mode=http;hive.server2.thrift.http.path=<http_endpoint>\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the Spark SQL CLI\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spark SQL CLI is a convenient tool to run the Hive metastore service\n",
    "in local mode and execute queries input from the command line. Note that\n",
    "the Spark SQL CLI cannot talk to the Thrift JDBC server.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start the Spark SQL CLI, run the following in the Spark directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ./bin/spark-sql\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration of Hive is done by placing your `hive-site.xml`,\n",
    "`core-site.xml` and `hdfs-site.xml` files in `conf/`. You may run\n",
