    "========================================\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the project deals with distributed singular value\n",
    "decomposition. The singular value decomposition of a real matrix $A$ is\n",
    "given by \\\\\\[A= U S V^T,\\\\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S$ is a diagonal matrix of size $n\\\\times n$ and $U$ ($m\\\\times\n",
    "n$ ) and $V$ ($n\\\\times n$) are real matrices such that $U^T U =I$ and\n",
    "$V^T V=I$. (See for example &lt;a\n",
    "href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular*value*decomposition\"&gt;wikipedia\n",
    "&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a\n",
    "href=\"https://web.mit.edu/be.400/www/SVD/Singular*Value*Decomposition.htm\"&gt;MIT\n",
    "&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a\n",
    "href=\"https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SingularValueDecomposition.html\"&gt;WolframMathworld\n",
    "&lt;/a&gt;). A standard way of computing this is to first compute the\n",
    "product $A^T A= VDV^T$. The matrix S is then obtained by taking the\n",
    "square root of the diagonal of $D$ and finally we obtain $U$ by\n",
    "computing $U = AV S^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When one has large matrices and wants to compute the SVD distributed one\n",
    "takes into account the structure of the matrix and choose an algorithm\n",
    "that takes advantage of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "One particular case is when one wants to compute the singular value\n",
    "decomposition of a so called \"tall and skinny\" matrix $A$. This means\n",
    "that the number of rows $m$ is much larger than the number of columns\n",
    "$n$. An example of where this is the case is the Audioscrobbler\n",
    "recommender system used by &lt;a\n",
    "href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last.fm\"&gt;Last.fm &lt;/a&gt;. The\n",
    "typicall dataset will be a tall and skinny matrix where each row\n",
    "contains three entries; an identifier for a song, an identifier for a\n",
    "user and a player count (so each row tells us how many times a user has\n",
    "played a song).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at an algorithm in spark for computing the SVD where one\n",
    "make use of the structure of the tall and skinny matrix $A$. The\n",
    "algorithm has the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It is computationally expensive to compute the product $A^T A$ so we\n",
    "    compute this distributed (map-reduce).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $A^T A$ is of size $n\\\\times n$ ( $n$ is small) so we can compute\n",
    "    $V$ and $S$ locally by computing the eigenvectors and -values of\n",
    "    $A^TA$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   We then compute $U= AVS^{-1}$ as distributed matrix multiplication\n",
    "    by broadcasting $VS^{-1}$ to each partition and compute the\n",
    "    multiplication with the rows of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the spark mllib library theres a package for distributed linear\n",
    "algebra (&lt;a\n",
    "href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/mllib-data-types.html\"&gt;Data\n",
