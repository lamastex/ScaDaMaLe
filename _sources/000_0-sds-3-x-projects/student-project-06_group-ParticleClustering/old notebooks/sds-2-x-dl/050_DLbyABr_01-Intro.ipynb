    "-   Understand deep learning!\n",
    "    -   Acquire an intiution and feeling for how and why and when it\n",
    "        works, so you can use it!\n",
    "    -   No magic! (or at least very little magic)\n",
    "-   We *don't* want to have a workshop where we install and demo some\n",
    "    magical, fairly complicated thing, and we watch it do something\n",
    "    awesome, and handwave, and go home\n",
    "    -   That's great for generating excitement, but leaves\n",
    "        -   Theoretical mysteries -- what's going on? do I need a Ph.D.\n",
    "            in Math or Statistics to do this?\n",

    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's start by diving right in and discussing an interesing problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "MNIST Digits Dataset\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Called the \"Drosophila\" of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Likely the most common single dataset out there in deep learning, just\n",
    "complex enough to be interesting and useful for benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"If your code works on MNIST, that doesn't mean it will work everywhere;\n",
    "but if it doesn't work on MNIST, it probably won't work anywhere\" :)\n",
    "\n",
    "&lt;img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uggRlE7.png\" width=600&gt;\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the goal?\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert an image of a handwritten character into the correct\n",
    "classification (i.e., which character is it?)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is nearly trivial for a human to do! Most toddlers can do this with\n",
    "near 100% accuracy, even though they may not be able to count beyond 10\n",
    "or perform addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally this had been quite a hard task for a computer to do. 99%\n",
    "was not achieved until ~1998. Consistent, easy success at that level was\n",
    "not until 2003 or so.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let's describe the specific problem in a little more detail\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Each image is a 28x28 pixel image\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   originally monochrome; smoothed to gray; typically inverted, so\n",
    "        that \"blank\" pixels are black (zeros)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   So the **predictors** are 784 (28 \\* 28 = 784) values, ranging from\n",
    "    0 (black / no ink when inverted) to 255 (white / full ink when\n",
    "    inverted)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The **response** -- what we're trying to predict -- is the number\n",
    "    that the image represents\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   the response is a value from 0 to 9\n",
    "    -   since there are a small number of discrete catagories for the\n",
    "        responses, this is a **classification** problem, not a\n",
    "        **regression** problem\n",
    "    -   there are 10 classes\n",
    "\n",
    "-   We have, for each data record, predictors and a response to train\n",
    "    against, so this is a **supervised** learning task\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The dataset happens to come partitioned into a **training set**\n",
    "    (60,000 records) and a **test set** (10,000 records)\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   We'll \"hold out\" the test set and not train on it\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Once our model is trained, we'll use it to **predict** (or perform\n",
    "    **inference**) on the test records, and see how well our trained\n",
    "    model performs on unseen test data\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   We might want to further split the training set into a\n",
    "        **validation set** or even several **K-fold partitions** to\n",
    "        evaluate as we go\n",
    "\n",
    "-   As humans, we'll probably measure our success by using **accuracy**\n",
    "    as a metric: What fraction of the examples are correctly classified\n",
    "    by the model?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   However, for training, it makes more sense to use\n",
    "        **cross-entropy** to measure, correct, and improve the model.\n",
    "        Cross-entropy has the advantage that instead of just counting\n",
    "        \"right or wrong\" answers, it provides a continuous measure of\n",
    "        \"how wrong (or right)\" an answer is. For example, if the correct\n",
    "        answer is \"1\" then the answer \"probably a 7, maybe a 1\" is\n",
    "        wrong, but *less wrong* than the answer \"definitely a 7\"\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Do we need to pre-process the data? Depending on the model we use,\n",
    "    we may want to ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Scale** the values, so that they range from 0 to 1, or so that\n",
    "        they measure in standard deviations\n",
    "    -   **Center** the values so that 0 corresponds to the (raw central)\n",
    "        value 127.5, or so that 0 corresponds to the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What might be characteristics of a good solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   As always, we need to balance **variance** (malleability of the\n",
    "    model in the face of variation in the sample training data) and\n",
    "    **bias** (strength/inflexibility of assumptions built in to the\n",
    "    modeling method)\n",
    "-   We a model with a good amount of **capacity** to represent different\n",
    "    patterns in the training data (e.g., different handwriting styles)\n",
    "    while not **overfitting** and learning too much about specific\n",
    "    training instances\n",
    "-   We'd like a **probabalistic model** that tells us the most likely\n",
    "    classes given the data and assumptions (for example, in the U.S., a\n",
    "    one is often written with a vertical stroke, whereas in Germany it's\n",
    "    usually written with 2 strokes, closer to a U.S. 7)\n",
    "\n",
    "Going a little further,\n",
    "\n",
    "-   an ideal modeling approach might perform **feature selection** on\n",
    "    its own deciding which pixels and combinations of pixels are most\n",
    "    informative\n",
    "-   in order to be robust to varying data, a good model might learn\n",
    "    **hierarchical or abstract features** like lines, angles, curves and\n",
    "    loops that we as humans use to teach, learn, and distinguish Arabic\n",
    "    numerals from each other\n",
    "-   it would be nice to add some basic **domain knowledge** like these\n",
    "    features aren't arbitrary slots in a vector, but are parts of a\n",
    "    2-dimensional image where the contents are roughly **axis-aligned**\n",
    "    and **translation invariant** -- after all, a \"7\" is still a \"7\"\n",
    "    even if we move it around a bit on the page\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it would be great to have a framework that is flexible enough to\n",
    "adapt to similar tasks -- say, Greek, Cyrillic, or Chinese handwritten\n",
    "characters, not just digits.\n",
