    "    convolutional, recurrent, and combinations of those.\n",
    "-   We will still train in batches using some variant of gradient\n",

    "Principal Approaches: Deep Q-Learning and Policy Gradient Learning\n",
    "==================================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Policy Gradient is straightforward and shows a lot of research\n",
    "    promise, but can be quite difficult to use. The challenge is less in\n",
    "    the math, code, or concepts, and more in terms of effective\n",
    "    training. We'll look very briefly at PG.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Deep Q-Learning is more constrained and a little more complex\n",
    "    mathematically. These factors would seem to cut against the use of\n",
    "    DQL, but they allow for relatively fast and effective training, so\n",
    "    they are very widely used. We'll go deeper into DQL and work with an\n",
    "    example.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, of course, many variants on these as well as some other\n",
    "strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy Gradient Learning\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "With Policy Gradient Learning, we directly try to learn a \"policy\"\n",
    "function that selects a (possibly continuous-valued) move for an agent\n",
    "to make given the current state of the \"world.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to maximize total discounted future reward, but we do not need\n",
    "discrete actions to take or a model that tells us a specific \"next\n",
    "reward.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can make fine-grained moves and we can collect all the moves\n",
    "that lead to a reward, and then apply that reward to all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "> **ASIDE:** The term *gradient* here comes from a formula which\n",
    "> indicates the gradient (or steepest direction) to improve the policy\n",
    "> parameters with respect to the loss function. That is, which direction\n",
    "> to adjust the parameters to maximize improvement in expected total\n",
    "> reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",

    "other approach we'll work with, Deep Q-Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges with Policy Gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy gradients, despite achieving remarkable results, are a form of\n",
    "brute-force solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus they require a large amount of input data and extraordinary amounts\n",
    "of training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these challenges come down to the *credit assignment problem* --\n",
    "properly attributing reward to actions in the past which may (or may\n",
    "not) be responsible for the reward -- and thus some mitigations include\n",
    "more complex reward functions, adding more frequent reward training into\n",
    "the system, and adding domain knowledge to the policy, or adding an\n",
    "entire separate network, called a \"critic network\" to learn to provide\n",
    "feedback to the actor network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge is the size of the search space, and tractable\n",
    "approaches to exploring it.\n",

    "\n",
    "Deep Q-Learning is deep learning applied to \"Q-Learning.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is Q-Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-Learning is a model that posits a map for optimal actions for each\n",
    "possible state in a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, given a state and an action, there is a \"Q-function\" that\n",
    "provides the value or quality (the Q stands for quality) of that action\n",
    "taken in that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if an agent is in state s, choosing an action could be as simple as\n",
    "looking at Q(s, a) for all a, and choosing the highest \"quality value\"\n",
    "-- aka &lt;img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/RerRQzk.png\" width=110&gt;\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some other considerations, such as explore-exploit tradeoff,\n",
    "but let's focus on this Q function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In small state spaces, this function can be represented as a table, a\n",
    "bit like basic strategy blackjack tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "&lt;img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rfxLSls.png\" width=400&gt;\n",
    "\n",
    "Even a simple Atari-style video game may have hundreds of thousands of\n",
    "states, though. This is where the neural network comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we need is a way to learn a Q function, when we don't know what\n",
    "the error of a particular move is, since the error (loss) may be\n",
    "dependent on many future actions and can also be non-deterministic\n",
    "(e.g., if there are randomly generated enemies or conditions in the\n",
    "game).**\n",
    "\n",
    "The tricks -- or insights -- here are:\n",

    "\\[1\\] Model the total future reward -- what we're really after -- as a\n",
    "recursive calculation from the immediate reward (*r*) and future\n",

    "\n",
    "-   ${\\\\gamma}$ is a \"discount factor\" on future reward\n",
    "-   Assume the game terminates or \"effectively terminates\" to make the\n",
    "    recursion tractable\n",
    "-   This equation is a simplified case of the Bellman Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[2\\] Assume that if you iteratively run this process starting with an\n",
    "arbitrary Q model, and you train the Q model with actual outcomes, your\n",

    "seems intuitively to resemble various Monte Carlo sampling methods (if\n",
    "that helps at all)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### As improbable as this might seem at first for teaching an agent a complex game or task, it actually works, and in a straightforward way.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we apply this to our neural network code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike before, when we called \"fit\" to train a network automatically,\n",
    "here we'll need some interplay between the agent's behavior in the game\n",
    "and the training. That is, we need the agent to play some moves in order\n",
    "to get actual numbers to train with. And as soon as we have some actual\n",
    "numbers, we want to do a little training with them right away so that\n",
    "our Q function improves. So we'll alternate one or more in-game actions\n",
    "with a manual call to train on a single batch of data.\n",

    "    calculated in step 2). For all other actions, set the Q-value target\n",
    "    to the same as originally returned from step 1, making the error 0\n",
    "    for those outputs.\n",
    "4.  Update the weights using backpropagation.\n",

    "If the game is win/lose only ... most of the r's go away and the entire\n",
    "loss is based on a 0/1 or -1/1 score at the end of a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Consideration 1: Experience Replay\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve training, we cache all (or as much as possible) of the\n",
    "agent's state/move/reward/next-state data. Then, when we go to perform a\n",
    "training run, we can build a batch out of a subset of all previous\n",
    "moves. This provides diversity in the training data, whose value we\n",
    "discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Consideration 2: Explore-Exploit Balance\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to add more diversity to the agent's actions, we set a\n",
    "threshold (\"epsilon\") which represents the probability that the agent\n",
    "ignores its experience-based model and just chooses a random action.\n",
    "This also add diversity, by preventing the agent from taking an\n",
    "overly-narrow, 100% greedy (best-perfomance-so-far) path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's Look at the Code!\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning code examples are a bit more complex than the\n",
    "other examples we've seen so far, because in the other examples, the\n",
    "data sets (training and test) exist outside the program as assets (e.g.,\n",
    "the MNIST digit data).\n",
    "\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, the training and reward data come from some\n",
    "environment that the agent is supposed to learn. Typically, the\n",
    "environment is simulated by local code, or *represented by local code*\n",
    "even if the real environment is remote or comes from the physical world\n",
    "via sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So the code contains not just the neural net and training logic, but part (or all) of a game world itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most elegant small, but complete, examples comes courtesy of\n",
    "former Ph.D. researcher (Univ. of Florida) and Apple rockstar Eder\n",
    "Santana. It's a simplified catch-the-falling-brick game (a bit like\n",
    "Atari Kaboom! but even simpler) that nevertheless is complex enough to\n",
    "illustrate DQL and to be impressive in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we're done, we'll basically have a game, and an agent that plays,\n",
    "which run like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "&lt;img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/PB6OgNF.gif\"&gt;\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's get familiar with the game environment itself, since we'll\n",
    "need to see how it works, before we can focus on the reinforcement\n",
    "learning part of the program."
