    "By plotting the collected data as cartograms/choropleth maps across\n",
    "different time intervals we were able to visualize change in tweet\n",
    "frequency around the holidays. In particular we noticed an increase in\n",

    "We were probably a bit too cautious when only collecting data for three\n",
